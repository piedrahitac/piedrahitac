# Hello there, stranger! 👽

I'm glad you're here, welcome. If you are wondering what happened to the little green squares, it's just that I don't usually hang out around these corners of the internet unless my current project requires it. I've been building software profesionally for over 15 years, and still have gas left in the tank!

## 👾 Fun things I do well
- Creating and maintaining SaaS apps with Ruby on Rails.
- Juggling microservices with Java and Spring.
- Using relational databases to keep data safe.

## 🛸 Less fun things I can also do
- Wrestling Javascript / Typescript to build web UIs.
- Setting up monitoring and observability tools.

Thanks for the visit, see you around! 🪐
