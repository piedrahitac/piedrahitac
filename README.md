# Hi there, stranger! 👽

I've been building software professionally for over 15 years. I enjoy creating high-quality, user-focused products and thrive in collaborative, cross-functional teams. I bring strong communication, positive energy, ownership, and interest in building relationships that support meaningful work.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are wondering what happened to the little green squares, it's just that I don't usually hang out around these corners of the internet unless my current project requires it.

## 👾 Fun things I do well
- Building SaaS apps with Ruby on Rails.
- Juggling microservices with Java and Spring.
- Using relational databases to keep data safe.
- Leading and mentoring software engineering teams.

## 🛸 Other fun things I can do too
- Wrestling Javascript / Typescript into web UIs.
- Setting up monitoring and observability tools.
- Flying through cloud services like AWS and GCP.
- Managing CI/CD pipelines.

Thanks for the visit, see you around! 🪐
